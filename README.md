# ExchangeRatesApp

ExchangeRateApp is an application that allows you to check current buying and selling exchange rates. 
The currency for which exchange rates of other currencies are given is Polish zloty. The data is downloaded 
using the NBP Web API (API of the National Bank of Poland) in JSON format. Maven was used for the application 
along with two libraries Apache Commons-IO (commons-io) and JSON in Java (org.json).
